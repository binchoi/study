# 0x100 Introduction

What comes to your mind when you hear 'hacking'? 

Electronic vandalism? Breaking laws? Criminal activity? Admittedly, there are people out there who abuse hacking for such causes.

However, You may be surprised to learn that hacking is more about following the law than breaking it.

> The essence of hacking is finding unintended or overlooked uses for the laws and properties of a given situation and then applying them in new and inventive ways to solve a problem—whatever it may be.

## Origin of Hacking
In the late 1950s, the MIT model railroad club was given a donation of old telephone equipment. The club’s members used parts from this equipment to rig up a complex system that allowed multiple operators to control different parts of the track by dialing in to the appropriate sections. 

They called this new and inventive use of telephone equipment hacking. This group is regarded by many as the original hackers.

These early hackers were focused on writing programs that solved problems with *elegance*. They transformed programming from a mere engineering task into an art form.

They saw programming as a form of artistic expression and the computer as an instrument of that art. Their desire to dissect and understand wasn’t to demystify artistic endeavors; it was simply a way to achieve a greater appreciation of them. These knowledge-driven values would eventually be called the Hacker Ethic.

> **Hacker Ethic**: the appreciation of logic as an art form and the promotion of the free flow of information, surmounting conventional boundaries and restrictions for the simple goal of
better understanding the world
